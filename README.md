# Albatross

A modern Blazor WebAssembly application that provides comprehensive IP address analysis and abuse checking functionality. Albatross combines cloud IP range detection with AbuseIPDB reputation checking through a secure Cloudflare Worker proxy.

## Features

- **IP Abuse Checking**: Query the AbuseIPDB API to check if an IP address has been reported for malicious activity
- **Cloud IP Range Detection**: Identify if an IP address belongs to major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle Cloud)
- **Flexible Input Format**: Support for IP addresses with custom report age (e.g., `8.8.8.8;60` for 60 days of history)
- **Combined Data Sources**: Integrated AbuseIPDB and Cloudflare Radar API data for comprehensive IP analysis
- **Secure Authentication**: Build-time generated HMAC authentication with timestamp validation for enhanced security
- **CORS Protection**: Cloudflare Worker proxy handles CORS and protects API keys from client exposure
- **SEO-Optimized**: Static HTML prerendering for improved search engine indexing and web crawler accessibility
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive Blazor WebAssembly interface with real-time JSON formatting
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Security Architecture

This application implements a multi-layered security system with the following components:

### Build-Time Key Generation
- **Cryptographically Secure Keys**: Each build generates a unique 256-bit authentication key using `RNGCryptoServiceProvider`
- **HMAC Authentication**: Uses HMAC-SHA256 for request authentication between the Blazor app and Cloudflare Worker
- **Timestamp Validation**: 2-minute window validation to prevent replay attacks
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Authentication keys are generated at build time and never stored in source code

### Authentication Flow
1. **Build Process**: Generates unique authentication key and injects it into both C# and JavaScript code
2. **Client Request**: Blazor app creates HMAC token using the generated key, full request URL, and UTC timestamp
3. **Timestamp Check**: Worker validates that the request timestamp is within 2 minutes of current UTC time
4. **HMAC Validation**: Cloudflare Worker validates the HMAC token using the same generated key and full URL
5. **Origin Validation**: Additional CORS and origin checking for browser-based requests
6. **API Proxy**: Upon successful authentication, worker proxies the request to external APIs

## Build System

The project uses MSBuild targets for automated key generation and code injection:

### Pre-Build Process
1. **Key Generation** (`GenerateAuthKey` target):
   - Runs `Generate-AuthKey.ps1` PowerShell script
   - Generates cryptographically secure 256-bit key
   - Creates multiple output formats (C#, JavaScript, environment files, JSON)

2. **Worker Processing** (`ProcessWorker` target):
   - Runs `Process-Worker.ps1` PowerShell script
   - Injects generated constants into `cloudflare-worker.template.js`
   - Outputs final `cloudflare-worker.js` with embedded authentication

### Generated Files
- `Generated/BuildConstants.cs` - C# constants for the Blazor app
- `Generated/build-constants.js` - JavaScript constants for worker injection
- `Generated/build.env` - Environment file format
- `Generated/build-manifest.json` - Build metadata and timestamps
- `cloudflare-worker.js` - Final worker with injected authentication

## Prerendering

Albatross uses **[BlazorWasmPreRendering.Build](https://github.com/jsakamoto/BlazorWasmPreRendering.Build)** to generate static HTML during the publish process, improving SEO and web crawler accessibility.

### How It Works
- **Build-Time Rendering**: During `dotnet publish`, the app is rendered to static HTML
- **SEO Benefits**: Search engines can index content without executing JavaScript
- **Hidden Content**: Prerendered HTML is hidden (opacity: 0, z-index: -1) to prevent visual flash
- **Blazor Hydration**: The app seamlessly takes over after loading, providing full interactivity
- **Zero Runtime Overhead**: Prerendering happens at build time, not on the server

### Implementation
For prerendering to work, service registration must be extracted into a static local function in `Program.cs`:
```csharp
static void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services, string baseAddress)
{
    services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(baseAddress) });
    services.AddScoped<AbuseIPDBService>(/* ... */);
}
```

See the [BlazorWasmPreRendering.Build documentation](https://github.com/jsakamoto/BlazorWasmPreRendering.Build#services-registration) for more details.

### Verification
To verify prerendering is working after deployment:
```bash
# Check for prerendering markers in the HTML
curl -s https://albatross.devnomadic.com | grep "PRERENDERING-BEGIN"

# Or view page source in browser and search for:
<!-- %%-PRERENDERING-BEGIN-%% -->
```

If prerendering is working, you'll see the full app structure in the HTML source, not just "Loading..."

## Setup and Development

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Node.js 20.0.0 or higher (required for Cloudflare Wrangler 4)
- PowerShell (cross-platform)
- AbuseIPDB API key
- Cloudflare Workers account (for deployment)

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Update `cloudflare-worker.template.js` with your AbuseIPDB API key
3. Build the project: `dotnet build`
4. Run the application: `dotnet run`

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive unit test suite to ensure IP range matching accuracy across IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

### Test Coverage
- **Total Tests**: 41 unit tests
- **Test Framework**: xUnit 2.4.2
- **Target Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Test Categories**:
  - IPv4 basic matching and validation
  - IPv6 basic matching and validation
  - Boundary condition testing (first/last address in ranges)
  - Edge cases (single hosts /32 and /128, large networks /0)
  - Real-world cloud provider IP ranges (AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle)
  - Invalid input handling (malformed CIDR, out-of-range prefixes)
  - Mixed version validation (IPv4 vs IPv6 range mismatches)

### Running Tests

**Run all tests:**
```bash
dotnet test Tests/Albatross.Tests.csproj
```

**Run tests with detailed output:**
```bash
dotnet test Tests/Albatross.Tests.csproj --logger "console;verbosity=normal"
```

**Run tests as part of the build:**
```bash
./build.sh
```

The build script automatically:
1. Updates cloud IP manifests
2. Runs all unit tests
3. Builds and publishes the application (only if tests pass)

## Configuration

## Configuration

### GitHub Actions Deployment

The project uses unified GitHub Actions workflows that build and deploy both the SPA and Worker together:

- **Development/Preview**: `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml` - Deploys to staging environments on feature branches and PRs
- **Production**: `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` - Deploys to production environment on main branch

**Worker Environments:**
- **Production**: `abuseipdb` worker with `production` environment
- **Preview**: `abuseipdb` worker with `preview` environment
- **Same URL**: `https://abuseipdb.devnomadic.workers.dev` for both (differentiated by environment variables)

**SPA Environments:**
- **Production**: Main Cloudflare Pages project (deployed from main branch)
- **Preview**: Branch-specific preview URLs (deployed from feature branches and PRs)

### GitHub Secrets
Configure these secrets in your repository settings (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions):

**Required for Cloudflare Deployment:**
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Custom Cloudflare API token with Workers and Pages permissions
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID  
- `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_PROJECT` - Your Cloudflare Pages project name (e.g., `abuseipdb-spa`)

**Required for Worker Deployment:**
- `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY` - Your production API key from [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)
- `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY_DEV` - Your development API key from [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)

### Local Development
For local development, update the fallback API key in `cloudflare-worker.template.js` or set up environment variables.

### Allowed Origins
Configure the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` array in the worker template to specify which domains can access your API proxy.

### Worker URL
Update the `BaseUrl` in `AbuseIPDBService.cs` with your deployed Cloudflare Worker URL.

## Security Notes

- **Key Rotation**: Authentication keys are regenerated with each build, providing automatic key rotation
- **Request Validation**: All requests are validated using HMAC-SHA256 authentication with full URL signing
- **Timestamp Validation**: 2-minute window validation prevents replay attacks and ensures request freshness
- **Origin Control**: CORS headers restrict access to configured allowed origins
- **Browser-Only Access**: Worker validates User-Agent headers to ensure requests come from legitimate browsers
- **Production Origins Only**: Localhost and development origins are blocked in production deployments
- **API Key Protection**: External API keys (AbuseIPDB, Cloudflare Radar) are never exposed to client-side code
- **Multi-Layer Authentication**: HMAC authentication, timestamp validation, and origin validation must all pass
- **Input Validation**: All IP addresses are validated for proper format and public routability
- **GitHub Advanced Security**: CodeQL analysis, dependency scanning, and security workflows enabled

## Advanced Features

### Flexible Input Format
Users can specify custom report age limits using a semicolon delimiter:
- `8.8.8.8` - Uses default 30 days
- `8.8.8.8;60` - Uses 60 days of report history
- `2001:4860:4860::8888;90` - IPv6 with 90 days

### Combined API Integration
- **AbuseIPDB**: IP reputation and abuse reports
- **Cloudflare Radar**: ASN information and network details
- **Parallel Processing**: Both APIs are queried simultaneously for optimal performance
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial results if one API fails
